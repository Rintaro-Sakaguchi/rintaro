I am a first-year masterâ€™s student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Osaka University.In my research, I use machine learning techniques.I mainly develop using TensorFlow and PyTorch, and I am currently studying JAX as well.I am particularly interested in new architectures and frequently conduct surveys of the latest research.
